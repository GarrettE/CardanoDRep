# No on Treasury Cut Reduction Proposal

After careful consideration of the proposal to reduce the Cardano treasury cut from 20% to 10%, I have decided to vote no. While I acknowledge the potential benefits of increased staking rewards and the theoretical potential for improved decentralization, I believe the proposal, as presented, carries significant risks that outweigh the potential gains and ultimately jeopardizes the long-term health and sustainability of the Cardano ecosystem. My reasoning is as follows:

1. **Over-Reliance on ADA Price Appreciation**  
    The proposal’s justification relies heavily on the assumption of significant and sustained ADA price appreciation. Basing such a fundamental economic decision on speculation introduces an unacceptable level of risk without a comprehensive financial model demonstrating treasury sustainability under various price scenarios.

2. **Insufficient Analysis of Long-Term Treasury Health**  
    Simply being within a constitutional allowance (10%) does not guarantee financial sustainability. A detailed projection of treasury reserves under various transaction volumes, development costs, and grant funding needs should be provided to ensure critical long-term ecosystem funding.

3. **Potential Negative Impact on Ecosystem Development**  
    Reducing the treasury directly means less funding for grants, development initiatives, and community projects. While increased transaction volume may eventually support growth, this is a long-term aspiration and should not prematurely displace reliable treasury funding in the short to medium term.

4. **Unproven Correlation Between Increased Staking Rewards and Decentralization**  
    Higher staking rewards do not necessarily equate to more decentralization. Larger entities could still consolidate stake, and the proposal lacks a concrete plan to address potential centralization risks.

5. **Lack of Contingency Planning**  
    In scenarios where ADA price or transaction volume remains low, the reduced treasury could quickly deplete. A clear plan of action or mechanism for adjusting the treasury cut in unfavorable market conditions is notably absent.

6. **Premature Implementation**  
    Implementing such a significant change before fully transitioning to the new constitution and establishing robust treasury management processes is premature. Sound governance mechanisms and financial oversight should be in place before altering the funding model.

In conclusion, I cannot support this proposal due to its speculative basis, insufficient long-term analysis, potential negative impacts on development, and inadequate risk mitigation strategies. I urge the community to engage in a more thorough, data-driven discussion to determine Cardano’s best path forward.
