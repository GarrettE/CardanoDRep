    "comment": "No on Treasury Cut Reduction Proposal\n\nAfter careful consideration of the proposal to reduce the Cardano treasury cut from 20% to 10%, I have decided to vote no. While I acknowledge the potential benefits of increased staking rewards and the theoretical potential for improved decentralization, I believe the proposal, as presented, carries significant risks that outweigh the potential gains and ultimately jeopardizes the long-term health and sustainability of the Cardano ecosystem.  My reasoning is detailed below:\n\n1. Over-Reliance on ADA Price Appreciation: \n\nThe proposal's justification for a reduced treasury cut heavily relies on the assumption of significant and sustained ADA price appreciation. While price appreciation is a desirable outcome, it is not a guaranteed factor and is influenced by a multitude of external market forces beyond the control of the Cardano community.  Basing such a fundamental economic decision on speculation rather than concrete financial modeling is imprudent and introduces an unacceptable level of risk.  A comprehensive financial model demonstrating treasury sustainability under various ADA price scenarios, including stagnant or declining prices, is critically lacking.  Without this, we risk severely depleting the treasury during periods of market downturn, hindering our ability to fund essential development and ecosystem growth.\n\n2. Insufficient Analysis of Long-Term Treasury Health: \n\nThe proposal fails to provide a robust analysis of the long-term impact on the treasury's financial health.  While it mentions the constitutional allowance for a 10% cut, simply being within the allowed range does not guarantee financial sustainability.  A detailed projection of treasury reserves under different scenarios, including varying transaction volumes, development costs, and grant funding needs, is essential.  Without this information, we are essentially operating in the dark, potentially compromising the long-term funding required for critical infrastructure, security audits, and ongoing development efforts.\n\n3. Potential Negative Impact on Ecosystem Development: \n\nA reduced treasury directly translates to less funding available for grants, development initiatives, and community projects. This could significantly stifle innovation and slow down the growth of the Cardano ecosystem.  While the proposal suggests a shift towards organic growth driven by transaction volume, this is a long-term aspiration and should not be relied upon as a primary funding mechanism in the short to medium term.  Prematurely reducing treasury funding could have a chilling effect on developer activity and discourage new projects from building on Cardano.\n\n4. Unproven Correlation between Increased Staking Rewards and Decentralization:  \n\nWhile the proposal suggests that higher staking rewards will lead to improved decentralization, this is not necessarily guaranteed.  Large entities with significant ADA holdings could still consolidate stake, even with higher rewards.  Furthermore, the proposal lacks a concrete plan to address potential centralization risks.  Simply increasing rewards is not a sufficient solution to ensure a truly decentralized network.  More comprehensive strategies, such as promoting smaller stake pools and incentivizing diverse participation, are required.\n\n5. Lack of Contingency Planning:  \n\nThe proposal lacks any contingency planning for scenarios where ADA price appreciation does not materialize as expected or where transaction volume remains low.  In such situations, the reduced treasury could quickly become depleted, jeopardizing the long-term viability of the Cardano network.  A responsible approach requires a clear plan of action for mitigating these risks, including potential mechanisms for adjusting the treasury cut in the future if necessary.\n\n6. Premature Implementation: \n\nImplementing such a significant change before the full transition to the new constitution and the establishment of robust treasury management processes is premature.  We should prioritize establishing clear governance mechanisms, financial oversight, and community consensus on treasury management before making drastic changes to the funding model.\n\nIn conclusion, while the proposal to reduce the treasury cut has some theoretical merits, it is ultimately flawed due to its over-reliance on speculative price appreciation, insufficient analysis of long-term treasury health, potential negative impact on ecosystem development, and lack of robust risk mitigation strategies.  For these reasons, I cannot support this proposal and will be voting no. I urge the community to engage in a more thorough and data-driven discussion about the optimal treasury management strategy for Cardano's long-term success."
